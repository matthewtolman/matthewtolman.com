A lot has happened in the world this year. Most of the world has started
to move past COVID-19, especially in the U.S., regardless of whether
it's really gone. Russia has started a "special operations" (aka. military
invasion) inside Ukraine, has had the war go fairly poorly for it, and is
now trying to salvage what it can while hurting NATO and Ukraine as much
as it can - especially when it comes to energy prices (aka. gas and oil).
Elon Musk just bought Twitter, and it currently looks like the bird is on
a hard crash course with the ground. Meta has revealed it's spent multiple
billions of dollars in the metaverse. Mass layoffs in tech are starting
to happen, and there's talk of a coming recession (or maybe a depression).
That's also not mentioning the craziness in politics right now.

Fortunately, we're getting close to rounding out the year, so I thought
it might be fun to do a few predictions looking forward. My predictions
will mostly happen in tech related spaces since that's what I'm most
familiar with.

## Within a Year

In less than a year from now, my predictions is that the energy and
hardware costs for servers and data centers are going to rise. As such,
the costs of cloud services (such as AWS) will also rise. With these
rising costs, there will be two things that happen: more layoffs and
rising costs for online services. There is a chance that
these jumps in costs could be temporary and not much will change
once companies stabilize to the adjusted costs.

I'm also going to predict that prepaid phone plans will become more commonplace
within the next year as they are cheaper, and in an age of rampant
inflation that cost-cutting will be helpful for many families. Any sort
of SMS verification system that relies on post-paid plans will fall
apart and will need to adjust to stay relevant. I'm also expecting a lot
of phone number changes, and with those changes I'm expecting that some
people will be very upset when they realize how much terrible software
has been written which assumes that phone numbers don't change for a
person. Locked-out accounts will be commonplace for services with SMS-based
two-factor authentication. Fortunately, it may not be so commonplace as to
be news-breaking, assuming that the recession doesn't hit so bad that phone
number changes becomes widespread.

Manufacturing woes from China will start encouraging bigger companies to start
investing heavier in alternative factory locations. India would be the next
prime target for cheap labor and the U.S. would be good for stability in case
of major, global occurrences (such as an escalation in a global conflict).

### 2-3 Years

This far out becomes a bit harder to predict since there's a lot of
variables, so more of my predictions will have "conditions" in them.

If supply chain and energy issues continue steadily through this time, then
data center prices will really start rising. This will lead to companies looking
at how to cut down in hardware costs, since cutting more staff wouldn't be
sustainable after a while. The whole "microservice" movement will be slowing if
not halting altogether.

The increased in server costs and limitations in further cutting personnel
will disproportionately hit companies that have heavily invested in
"microservice" architecture. Microservice architectures usually result in much
higher developmental and server costs than either monolithic or the in-between
of larger service based architectures. These microservice companies will start
investigation how to amalgamate microservices into larger services. Many who
are "on the cloud" will also start investigating shifting over to non-cloud
solutions (or at least, move to data centers which don't have the "dynamic
scaling" premiums). New businesses that specialize in "cutting cloud costs",
"making microservices cheaper", and "moving off the cloud" will start cropping
up.

Services will also increase monetization efforts to help offset rising costs.
Video streaming services (YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, etc.) will be struggling during
this time period. Some streaming platforms will shut down, most likely platforms from
smaller studios who will then seek to license their videos onto other platforms for
money. By around this time, Netflix (if it's still around and is scoring good
license deals) may start calming down on its video game ambitions, though we will
probably start seeing some announcements from their studios created in 2022.

Larger video game companies will also be a bit more conservative in game genres
and game ideas. A recession, or at least higher levels of inflation, will
probably still be going on to some degree, so anything they can do to avoid
unnecessary risk will be needed. At many studios, this will mean cancellation of
internal projects and probably some layoffs.

I'm also guessing that is during this time period where one of the current major
social media platforms will probably fall (Meta, Twitter, TikTok, etc). Each
platform will fall for a different reason. I'll go over how each company would
fall if they did fall.

Meta would fall through its over-investment in the metaverse. I don't think Meta
would disappear entirely, but it would become a shell of its former self, and
Mark may have to step down form CEO (either voluntarily or involuntarily). Focus
under new leadership would put efforts away from VR/AR and back onto the social
platforms (a "right the ship"). This would then be coupled with either mass layoffs
inside the VR departments, or just selling the VR divisions. Unfortunately, Meta
doesn't face much opportunity for growth in the social media space by this point,
so it probably won't rise to its former glory.

Twitter would fall because of the Elon acquisition, and it would likely bring
down Tesla with it. The Elon acquisition saddled a non-profitable company with
massive amounts of debt. It also turned Twitter private, so selling shares to the
public to raise cash is not an option. Even if it was, the shares would be
so low in value compared to pre-privatization that it wouldn't be able to help much.
Regardless of how competently Elon led Twitter, in this scenario it would damage his
reputation a lot. Most likely, lots of Tesla stocks would have to be sold to try to
keep the bird in the air for as long as possible and/or to pay back investors who
funded the Musk deal in the first place. While Twitter and Tesla could still exist,
neither would be underneath Elon, who would be forced out by investors (who would
most likely file lawsuits to get money back). Additionally, several fines from the
SEC or FTC would be involved, and some current lawsuits against Twitter may be lost.
However, those fines and lawsuits would be supporting cast for the investor woes.

TikTok would most likely fall due to being banned or removed in several countries,
such as the U.S. Its position as a Chinese platform is already getting scrutiny
from several governments. In this scenario, that scrutiny turns into banning. If
TikTok did get ban, it would significantly weaken both future Chinese tech companies
entering non-Chinese markets and non-Chinese companies associated with Chinese tech
(including Chinese tech manufacturing plants). If TikTok did get banned, many
companies would create exit strategies to remove their dependencies on China.
Fortunately for TikTok, this type of fall wouldn't really involve an organizational
collapse. There may be a reduction (through layoffs), but the company would still
exist and be operating mostly as-is, but it would just be limited in the number of
markets it could be in.

If gig workers were ruled to be full employees of a company (such as Uber or Lyft),
by now we would be seeing greater financial strain on the gig-based companies with
a few of them shutting their doors. Uber, Lyft, Doordash, etc. aren't currently
profitable, and if they have to provide benefits and fair pay to drivers, then they
will become very unprofitable. Some of them will run out of cash and will have to
fold. Their competitors won't be faring much better. Prices for these services will
start climbing, and as they climb they will become less popular.

## 4-5 Years

Now we are really starting to get into theoretical territory.

By this time, there will be more system-typed programming languages that are
alternatives to both Rust and C/C++. While there are some languages today (like Zig),
they aren't supported well enough or have a large enough community to be a true
competitor. However, by this point some of those languages will be big enough to
start gaining some traction. The fact that they're easier than Rust and closer to
how the C/C++ community think will help them grow faster than Rust is growing. At
the same time, Rust will be starting to get some well-developed libraries, but it
will be struggling even more with the "steep learning curve" issues it's having now.
While Rust won't be going away, it won't be super popular either.

If server costs are still rising, even if infrequently, then we will see almost no
growth in "microservices" and an increasing movement into "efficient development."
Efficient development will involve both moving away from microservices and
prioritizing leaner code. Leaner code will mostly focus on libraries, at least at
this stage.

There would be some companies experimenting with rewrites in systems languages.
Many of the talks given by these companies would focus on Rust alternatives,
such as Zig, Jai, Carbon, or C++2. C++ would also start appearing in web conferences
again, but exclusively in its modern form or in one of the C++ compatible languages.
Rust would still be around and still be talked about, but by this point it won't be
the hot new thing on the block. Also, its many warts and complexities would really
be manifesting itself and would be slowing down large-scale adoption.
In another 3-5 years of increasing server costs most companies that still exist
on the cloud would start investing in rewrites to a faster language, however if server
costs are rising for 10 years straight then the internet will not have very many
companies remaining and services will be a lot more expensive.

By this time, if a multi-year recession had taken place, then there would be a lot
of internet users with older, slower, machines. A large gap in technological power
would emerge, with the elite few having newer, faster machines and everyone else
having much older hardware. Client rendered applications and Single-Page
Applications would be on the way out, and WASM would have to turn to somewhere
off the web to really get going.

On the flip side, if either the economic situation
stabilized, or if there was a quick recovery, then WASM would just be starting to
shine as the future of client-rendered content. By now, enough languages and
frameworks would be developed and refined to give it a fair shake. Microsoft's
Blazor framework (or future successor) would be leading the charge, at least
initially. Google would have their own WASM framework to catch up, and they may
try to merge it with Android application development. If WASM is being used heavily
for native applications, Apple would be working on their own framework to keep devs
using Macs and XCode for development, though they may not have it released by now.

Also, by now most new manufacturing by larger companies would be happening outside
of China. India would be charging into a major industrialization and modernization
era, spearheaded by newer development plants. China would be forced to adapt its
economic strategy.

### 6+ Years

"Made in India" not "Made in China" will be the new normal for most items. Some
higher quality or national security related items will be made in the Americas,
either the U.S. or Mexico.

If cloud or server costs are still rising, then most companies
will be fleeing the cloud quickly. Also, microservices would pretty much be dead
and efficient runtime would be lauded over quick development time. However, at this
length of time most companies would be struggling to make and keep an online presence.

Newer languages that combined both efficiency and ease of development would start
to emerge. These would be compiled languages that either used efficient reference
counting memory management, ownership, manual memory, or some new technique. They
would just be coming onto the scene, so it would take a while before there was
significant adoption. However, many of their ideas would also start being
incorporated into existing systems level languages to make those languages easier
to use.

### Conclusion

No one can see the future, so these are all predictions. I may be wrong on
everything, I may not be. It'll be interesting to see what I got right, and what
I got wrong. It'll also be interesting to see if there are things I correctly
predicted but missed on the timings (i.e. got the "what" but not the "when").
