A lot has happened in the world this year. Most of the world has started
to move past COVID-19, especially in the U.S., regardless of whether
it's really gone. Russia has started a "special operations" (aka. military
invasion) inside Ukraine, has had the war go fairly poorly for it, and is
now trying to salvage what it can while hurting NATO and Ukraine as much
as it can - especially when it comes to energy prices (aka. gas and oil).
Elon Musk just bought Twitter, and it currently looks like the bird is on
a hard crash course with the ground. Meta has revealed it's spent multiple
billions of dollars in the metaverse. Mass layoffs in tech are starting
to happen, and there's talk of a coming recession (or maybe a depression).
That's also not mentioning the craziness in politics right now.

Fortunately, we're getting close to rounding out the year, so I thought
it might be fun to do a few predictions looking forward. My predictions
will mostly happen in tech related spaces since that's what I'm most
familiar with.

## Within a Year

In less than a year from now, my predictions is that the energy and
hardware costs for servers and data centers are going to rise. As such,
the costs of cloud services (such as AWS) will also rise. With these
rising costs, there will be two things that happen: more layoffs and
rising costs for online services. There is a chance that
these jumps in costs could be temporary and not much will change
once companies stabilize to the adjusted costs.

I'm also going to predict that prepaid phone plans will become more commonplace
within the next year as they are cheaper, and in an age of rampant
inflation that cost-cutting will be helpful for many families. Any sort
of SMS verification system that relies on post-paid plans will fall
apart and will need to adjust to stay relevant. I'm also expecting a lot
of phone number changes, and with those changes I'm expecting that some
people will be very upset when they realize how much terrible software
has been written which assumes that phone numbers don't change for a
person. Locked-out accounts will be commonplace for services with SMS-based
two-factor authentication. It may not be so commonplace as to
be news-breaking, assuming that the recession doesn't hit so bad that phone
number changes becomes widespread.

Manufacturing woes from China will start encouraging bigger companies to start
investing heavier in alternative factory locations. India would be the next
prime target for cheap labor and the U.S. would be good for stability in case
of major, global occurrences (such as an escalation in a global conflict).

We will start seeing more resurgence in movie theaters and film releases.
Box-office numbers will start to return and there will be more hype around
releasing in theaters rather than just on a platform. While some companies
with large platforms (like Disney) will still try the "dual release" or
"online only" release, other studios with smaller platforms will really
start taking to the theaters.

## 2-3 Years

This far out becomes a bit harder to predict since there's a lot of
variables, so more of my predictions will have "conditions" in them.

If supply chain and energy issues continue steadily through this time, then
data center prices will really start rising. This will lead to companies looking
at how to cut down in hardware costs, since cutting more staff wouldn't be
sustainable after a while. The whole "microservice" movement will be slowing if
not halting altogether.

The increased in server costs and limitations in further cutting personnel
will disproportionately hit companies that have heavily invested in
"microservice" architecture. Microservice architectures usually result in much
higher developmental and server costs than either monolithic or the in-between
of larger service based architectures. These microservice companies will start
investigation how to amalgamate microservices into larger services. Many who
are "on the cloud" will also start investigating shifting over to non-cloud
solutions (or at least, move to data centers which don't have the "dynamic
scaling" premiums). New businesses that specialize in "cutting cloud costs",
"making microservices cheaper", and "moving off the cloud" will start cropping
up.

Services will also increase monetization efforts to help offset rising costs.
Video streaming services (YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, etc.) will be struggling during
this time period. Some streaming platforms will shut down, most likely platforms from
smaller studios who will then seek to license their videos onto other platforms for
money. By around this time, Netflix (if it's still around and is scoring good
license deals) may start calming down on its video game ambitions, though we will
probably start seeing some announcements from their studios created in 2022.

There will also start being a small movement to go away from "online all the time"
and "pay a subscription each month" and an increased focus on "one-time pay products"
or "pay to own". This movement will be small, but if service costs continue to rise
then the movement will start growing.

Larger video game companies will also be a bit more conservative in game genres
and game ideas. This may result in more indie studios with more outlandish ideas.
However, it will also result in increased game cost, either through aggressive
monetization or finally breaking the $60 price barrier.

During this time period is where one of the current major social media platforms
will probably fall (Meta, Twitter, TikTok, etc). The fall won't be "the company
no longer exists", but rather the "company is a shell of itself". Currently, there
is a lot of turmoil across the social media space, and it doesn't look like the
turmoil will be short-lived. TikTok is under intense pressure from many governments
which are wanting to ban it. Meta is sinking billions into the metaverse with no
end in sight, and the technology is too far away for it to become mainstream (I'm
guessing 8-10 years before AR/VR is mainstream). Twitter is saddled with a debt so
large the non-profitable company has to pay $1 billion dollars in interest annually.
All of these factors, if not addressed quickly, can cause massive trouble for a
major social media platform. I am predicting that some social media platforms
will figure out their issues, so not all of them will fall. But at least one is
going to struggle and will become a shell of itself as it undergoes massive
restructuring.

If gig workers are ruled to be full employees of a company (such as Uber or Lyft),
by now we would be seeing greater financial strain on the gig-based companies with
a few of them shutting their doors. Uber, Lyft, Doordash, etc. aren't currently
profitable, and if they have to provide benefits and fair pay to drivers, then they
will become very unprofitable. Some of them will run out of cash and will have to
fold. Their competitors won't be faring much better. Prices for these services will
start climbing, and as they climb they will become less popular.

## 4-5 Years

Now we are really starting to get into theoretical territory.

By this time, there will be more system-typed programming languages that are
alternatives to both Rust and C/C++. While there are some languages today (like Zig),
they aren't supported well enough or have a large enough community to be a true
competitor. However, by this point some of those languages will be big enough to
start gaining some traction. The fact that they're easier than Rust and closer to
how the C/C++ community think will help them grow faster than Rust is growing. At
the same time, Rust will be starting to get some well-developed libraries, but it
will be struggling even more with the "steep learning curve" issues it's having now.
While Rust won't be going away, it won't be super popular either.

If server costs are still rising, even if infrequently, then we will see almost no
growth in "microservices" and an increasing movement into "efficient development."
Efficient development will involve both moving away from microservices and
prioritizing leaner code. Leaner code will mostly focus on libraries, at least at
this stage.

There would be some companies experimenting with rewrites in systems languages.
Many of the talks given by these companies would focus on Rust alternatives,
such as Zig, Jai, Carbon, or C++2. C++ would also start appearing in web conferences
again, but exclusively in its modern form or in one of the C++ compatible languages.
Rust would still be around and still be talked about, but by this point it won't be
the hot new thing on the block. Also, its many warts and complexities would really
be manifesting itself and would be slowing down large-scale adoption.
In another 3-5 years of increasing server costs most companies that still exist
on the cloud would start investing in rewrites to a faster language, however if server
costs are rising for 10 years straight then the internet will not have very many
companies remaining and services will be a lot more expensive.

If services were still rising prices, then "one-time pay" products would be really
booming. Users would start preferring to pay for a DVD or a one-time Office
subscription instead of paying for something that is "always online". Monthly
fees would just be too much, and the "Software as a Service" business model would
get a bad reputation. Some more services, including paid ones, wil start dying out.
Of course, after the economy stabilizes for a few years, SaaS would come back, but
just with a different name.

By this time, if a multi-year recession had taken place, then there would be a lot
of internet users with older, slower, machines. A large gap in technological power
would emerge, with the elite few having newer, faster machines and everyone else
having much older hardware. Client rendered applications and Single-Page
Applications would be on the way out, and WASM would have to turn to somewhere
off the web to really get going.

On the flip side, if either the economic situation
stabilized, or if there was a quick recovery, then WASM would just be starting to
shine as the future of client-rendered content. By now, enough languages and
frameworks would be developed and refined to give it a fair shake. Microsoft's
Blazor framework (or future successor) would be leading the charge, at least
initially. Google would have their own WASM framework to catch up, and they may
try to merge it with Android application development. If WASM is being used heavily
for native applications, Apple would be working on their own framework to keep devs
using Macs and XCode for development, though they may not have it released by now.

Additionally, if SaaS prices stabilized, then it would be staying around for a long
time. Probably at least another decade. Stabilization could happen by: leaving the
cloud, removing microservice architectures from products, using more efficient
languages, and/or a restoration in supply chain costs and energy prices. Also, if
SaaS and server prices stabilized, then hybrid and remote work would start growing
more quickly. There would also be a larger exodus of highly-paid engineers leaving
California to go live somewhere cheaper.

Also, by now most new manufacturing by larger companies would be happening outside
of China. India would be charging into a major industrialization and modernization
era, spearheaded by newer manufacturing plants. China would be forced to adapt its
economic strategy. China would still be making products for many smaller companies,
and any existing product lines that were setup in China would remain through the
lifetime of the products being made.

## 6+ Years

"Made in India" not "Made in China" will be the new normal for most items. Some
higher quality or national security related items will be made in the Americas,
either the U.S. or Mexico. China will still have some manufacturing, but it will
be transitioning to a post-manufacturing economy.

If cloud or server costs are still rising, then most companies will be fleeing the
cloud quickly if they have not already fled. Also, microservices would pretty much
be dead and efficient runtime would be lauded over quick development time. However,
at this length of time most companies would be struggling to make and keep an online
presence. If server costs were still rising, there would be a rise in more traditional
communications, such as calling, texting, talking in person, etc. Hybrid or remote
work would really start dwindling after 5 years of increasing server costs.

That said, if server costs had stabilized before now then remote work would really
start taking off. There would also be startups dedicated to bringing remote work
and remote training to traditional trade jobs, such as carpentry, plumbing, and
electrical. These start-ups will be trying to address the shortage in trade jobs
by increasing the effective working area of trades workers. How successful these
companies will be is another matter.

Regardless of whether the server costs have been rising for 2 or 5 years, there
would be some interesting trends emerge in the technology space.

Newer languages that combined both efficiency and ease of development would start
to emerge by this time. These would be compiled languages that either used efficient
reference counting memory management, ownership, manual memory, or some new
technique. They would just be coming onto the scene, so it would take a while
before there was significant adoption. However, many of their ideas would also
start being incorporated into existing systems level languages to make those
languages easier to use. These languages would offer "ease of development",
"increased developer productivity", and "low to no cost for running" as the main
selling points. The pitch would be to save on both the human time and skill costs
as well as the server and infrastructure costs. Most of these new languages would
prioritize static linking and easy deployments.

Some newer languages would also really start thinking about how to train developers
on their language. There will be increased experimentation on how to make learning
quicker and more efficient for newer devs. Some languages will start splitting
developers into "application builders" and "library builders", with each one getting
content tailored to them. Some langauges will start focusing on interactive tutorials
instead of long-form content pages. Others will start focusing on some more intense
projects. A few will experiment with "language translations" where it shows examples
from languages devs are familiar with, and then the equivalent (generally shorter)
code in the new language. Some one else will come up with an idea not on this list.

More unikernel and microkernel projects would also be emerging by now. These
projects would again be retargetted to lowering server costs. Some of them may
also be trying to make the development process easier, but that is not the primary
focus. Consequently, they will remain more niche, though there will be slightly
more adoption than there is now.

It would be in this time period that VR and AR technologies would start to get
refined enough to be cool. However, premature marketing will have soured the
public's appetite for a while. At around the 8-10 year mark is when we'll see
AR/VR refined enough and remarketed enough that it starts to capture the public's
attention. Some new, very refined, device will most likely be what launches VR and
AR in the public mind.

Also, by now technology in schools will really be becoming part of the curriculum.
Robotics, programming, etc. will be taught at least in the high school level at the
vast majority of school districts.

## Conclusion

No one can see the future, so these are all predictions. I may be wrong on
everything, I may not be. It'll be interesting to see what I got right, and what
I got wrong. It'll also be interesting to see if there are things I correctly
predicted but missed on the timings (i.e. got the "what" but not the "when").
