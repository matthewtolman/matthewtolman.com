I recently created a website which holds a lot of my experiments. Some of these experiments either make it into my blog or they form the basis of some of my blog posts. Many of them don't make it into my blog posts. Instead of just letting them sit in the dark, I decided to put some of them on an experiments site.

The experiments aren't meant to be full products or even "final." Some of them have descriptions, others don't. Some of them are good ideas/implementations, others aren't. The navigation elements of the site are also different experiments themselves. It's less formal and "best practices" of a site and more of a test bed for different ideas I have or want to try out.

My experiments site is [matthewtolman.dev](https://matthewtolman.dev). Feel free to check it out!
